# 💡 AI Coding Tutor

An interactive web app that helps learners understand, debug, and improve Python code using **Generative AI**.

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as intelligent tutors for programming education — explaining code line by line, finding bugs, and suggesting improvements.  
It was created as part of my research interest in **AI-assisted learning and computing education**.
